# HabitTracker

Hey there! Imagine having a cool web app that lets you effortlessly create, update, and delete your daily habits. Plus, you can easily track your progress too! This app is personalized, meaning you can keep track of your own habits and mark them as done or not done. The project is built using a tech stack that includes Node.js for the server-side scripting, Express for handling HTTP requests and routing, MongoDB for storing and managing data, and EJS for rendering views and templates. Pretty neat, right?
